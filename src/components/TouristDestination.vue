  <p>The 40-foot Lion's Head monument along Kennon Road is a sight that welcomes thousands of visitors to Baguio City.
      Located in Camp 6, the Lion's Head measures 40 ft (12 m) in height. It was conceptualized by the Lions Club members of Baguio, during the term of Luis Lardizabal as mayor of Baguio from 1969 to 1970 and as the club's president, to become the club's symbol or imprint in the area.

  <summary>Chocolate Hill</summary>
  <p>Chocolate Hills in Bohol is a famed tourist attraction in the Philippines which continues to draw attention for its unique and majestic characteristics. There are more than 1,000 symmetrical mounds, conical and dome-shaped that most people liken them to Hershey’s Kisses.

  <summary>Vigan City</summary>
  <p>Established in the 16th century, Vigan is the best-preserved example of a planned Spanish colonial town in Asia. Its architecture reflects the coming together of cultural elements from elsewhere in the Philippines, from China and from Europe, resulting in a culture and townscape that have no parallel anywhere in East and South-East Asia.

  <summary>Puerto Princesa</summary>
  <p>Puerto Princesa City is the capital of and the only city in Palawan, Philippines. While it is considered a highly urbanized city, it still looks and feels more like a big town. And in the past few years, more like a boomtown. The city has been transforming, developing at a rate faster than I gain weight. Haha. A few new malls and several new big hotels now stand in what used to be a virtually flat city proper.

  <summary>Intramuros Manila</summary>
  <p>Known as the “Walled City,” Intramuros is a place rich in history and culture. With its cobbled streets and preserved architecture dated hundreds of years ago, it will have you second-guessing whether you are still in the Philippines or not. That is why many foreigners and locals never miss an Intramuros tour when in the city. 

In between the walls of Intramuros is the mark that 300 years of Spanish rule have left in the form of grand churches and colonial houses. While you can just wander the streets on your own, the best way to get a deeper understanding of the country’s history is with a historic Intramuros walking tour.</p>
